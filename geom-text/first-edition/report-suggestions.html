Suggestions for writing project reports:
<p>A short sample project report is available entitled <a href="sample-report.html">The
Amazing Pythagorean Theorem</a>
<p>After you have finished working on the constructions in the project
assignment, and have answered each of the questions, you need to write
a report that outlines the major theme(s) of the project, describes your
solutions or proofs to the questions, and concludes with a summary if what
was learned. This report is similar to papers that you write for other
classes in that it should have an introduction, a body and a conclusion.
<p>First, you should select a theme which you view as the most important
thing you wish the reader to glean from your report. I.e., try to make
some point. Then organize your report to best emphasize that point.
<p>The introduction explains to your readers what the paper is about. The
body of the report presents a brief description of the work done in the
project, together with answers to each of the project's questions. Although
each assignment presents a list of questions that are meant to guide you
through the project, you should not use these questions as the only organizing
principle in your report. That is, the report should not be just a list
of numbered questions and answers, as you would hand in for a homework
assignment. Instead, the report should have complete paragraphs and explanatory
prose, so that a reader not immersed in the subject matter of this course
can understand&nbsp; what you accomplished in the project. Finally, the
conclusion should summarize what you have learned.
<p>Assume the audience includes people who have taken high school geometry,
and know the vocabulary of the subject, but are not experts.

<br>Project report DOs and DON'Ts:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do use complete sentences, with
proper grammar and spelling.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't blindly write up your
project in the same order and format as the assignment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do structure your paper in a
logical way, with each section marked with a helpful title.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't use phrases like, ``In
this lab we learned about...,'' nor, ``We were asked to prove that ...''
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do use phrases like, `` From
this construction, we conjecture that ...'', and "To prove this conjecture,
..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't use the passive voice,
``A segment was constructed from A to B'', instead say
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
``Construct a segment from A to B.''
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't mix verb tenses. Usually,
I would recommend sticking to present tense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use figures to help clarify
and describe your work.&nbsp; Geometry is a visual subject,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
illustrate your ideas.
