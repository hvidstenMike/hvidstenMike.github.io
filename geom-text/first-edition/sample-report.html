<center>The Amazing Pythagorean Theorem</center>
<p style=""><b>Introduction</b> </p>
<div style="">The Pythagorean Theorem is perhaps the most famous
theorem in geometry, if not in all of mathematics. In this lab, we look
at one method of proving the Pythagorean Theorem by constructing a
special square. Part I of this report describes the construction used
in the proof and Part II gives a detailed explanation of why this
construction works, that is why the construction generates a proof of
the Pythagorean theorem. Finally, we conclude with some comments on the
many proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.</div>
<p style=""><b>Part I</b>: </p>
<div style="">To start out our investigation of the Pythagorean
Theorem, we assume that we have a right triangle with legs b and a and
hypotenuse c. Our first task construction is that of a segment
sub-divided into two parts of lengths a and b. Since a and b are
arbitrary, we just create a segment, attach a point, hide the original
segment, and draw two new segments as shown.</div>

</center>
<p style="" props="text-align:left">Then, we construct a square on side
a and a square on side b. The purpose of doing this is to create two
regions whose total area is a^2 + b^2. Clever huh? Constructing the
squares involved several rotations, but was otherwise straightforward. </p>

</center>
<p style="" props="text-align:left">The next construction was a bit
tricky. We define a translation from B to A and translate point C to get
point H. Then, we connect H to D and H to G, resulting in two right
triangles. In part II, we will prove that both of these right triangles
are congruent to the original right triangle. </p>

<p><img src="pyth2.gif" height="204" width="262"></p>
</center>
<p style="" props="text-align:left">Next, we hide segment BC and create
segments BH and HC. This is so that we have well-defined triangle sides
for the next step - rotating right triangle ADH 90 degrees about its
top vertex, and right triangle HGC -90 degrees about its top vertex. </p>

</center>
<p style="" props="text-align:left"><b>Part II</b>: </p>
<div style="" props="text-align:left">We will now prove that this
construction yields a square (on DH) of side length c, and thus, since
the area of this square is clearly equal to the sum of the areas of the
original two squares, we have a^2+b^2 = c^2, and our proof would be
complete.&nbsp; By SAS, triangle HCG must be congruent to the original
right triangle, and thus its hypotenuse must be c. Also, by SAS,
triangle DAH is also congruent to the original triangle, and so its
hypotenuse is also c. Then, angles AHD and CHG(= ADH) must sum to 90
degrees, and the angle DHG is a right angle. Thus, we have shown that
the construction yields a square on DH of side length c, and our proof
is complete.</div>
<p style="" props="text-align:left"><b>Conclusion</b>: </p>
<div style="" props="text-align:left">This was a very elegant proof of
the Pythagorean Theorem. In researching the topic of proofs of the
Pythagorean Theorem, we discovered that over 300 proofs of this theorem
have been discovered. Elisha Scott Loomis, a mathematics teacher from
Ohio, compiled many of these proofs into a book titled <u>The
Pythagorean Proposition</u>, published in 1928. This tidbit of
historical lore was gleaned from the Ask Dr. Math website
(http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62539.html). It seems that
people cannot get enough of proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.</div>
