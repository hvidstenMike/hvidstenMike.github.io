Project Field-Test Survey<br>
</span></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Goals and Objectives:</span><br>
</p>
<p>The goals for the author in writing the textbook, and in producing
the accompanying software, were <br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) to employ a discovery-based learning
approach as an integral component in the teaching and learning of
college geometry<br>
b) to integrate technology into the geometry course by developing
robust geometry software to accompany the written course materials<br>
c) to facilitate change in the instruction of college geometry by
providing faculty with a rich set of resources with which to implement
the previous goals<br>
d) to affect the attitudes of future secondary math teachers toward
discovery-learning and the use of technology with the goal of having
students implement these strategies in their own teaching. <br>
<br>
</div>
1. Based on your experience in teaching geometry from the project
materials, how effective has the project been in meeting the first
goal, the integration of discovery-learning into college
geometry?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>2. How well has the project met the second goal, the integration of
technology? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Have the project materials been helpful to you in designing and
teaching college geometry with a focus on discovery-learning and
technology? (the third goal) <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Please give your overall assessment in how effective the project
materials have been in shaping student attitudes toward the first two
goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those students who are planning careers in
education, have the project materials been effective in giving them a
model for their own teaching? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Content:</span><br>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Was the level of content in the text appropriate for the
students who enrolled in your course? Please give examples of chapters,
sections, that worked especially well, and conversely, sections that
were not effective. <br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>6. Please comment on the homework and projects. Was the level too
easy, too hard, about right? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
7.&nbsp; Which sections did you cover? Please comment on parts of the
text that you found essential, and also on parts that could be
omitted.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>8. Are there topics, alternative ways of presentation, that you
wished were in the text? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assessment:</span><br>
</p>
<p>9. The text is designed so that students will have frequent writing
assignments due to project reports.&nbsp; Did you find the inclusion of
writing into the course helpful to the students? Comment on the grading
of the writing assignments - was it manageable?&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
10. Would it be helpful to have more examples of writing (and grading
of writing) in the instructor's manual?<br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>11. Would it be helpful to have sample exams and alternate projects
in the instructor's guide? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Software:</span><br>
</p>
<p>12. Was the software effective in helping your students master
concepts? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
13. Did students find the software accessible (user-friendly)? <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
14. Are there any issues that need addressing with respect to the
software? (features you would like to add, bugs that need fixing, etc) <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous:<br>
</span>15. Any other issues, problems, successes, that you would like
to add to the evaluation of the project? <span
