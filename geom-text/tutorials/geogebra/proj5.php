						Construction of a BÃ©zier Curve </span><br>
						We start with three points A, B, and C with segments from A to B and from
						B to C. We attach a point A' to segment AB and measure the distance from 
						A to A' and the distance from A to B. (Use the Distance tool under the Angle
						button.) We rename  these two distances in the Algebra View by right-clicking
						on them and choosing 'Rename.' We rename them to shorten  the names as shown.
						Then, we calculate the ratio of AA' to AB by typing "AA'/AB" into the
						Input field. A new Number appears in the Algebra View with this ratio.   
						</p>

						<div class="tutorial-left">
						<p>  <span id = "dilate" class = "tutorial-p-head">
						Dilation </span><br>
						The next step is to use this ratio as a dilation factor to dilate point
							C to B by this ratio.  The dilation tool is located in the 
							Transformation group of tools. These are the tools located under
							the Reflect icon <img src = "images/geogebra-reflect-icon.png" 
							style = "width:25px;" alt="Reflect Button">. Choose the last one
							in this drop-down menu. This is the Dilate tool. With this tool now active,
							hover over this button and a tooltip will appear describing what 
							geometric objects are needed to define the dilation.

					<div class = "tutorial-row">
						<div class="tutorial-left">
						<p>  The tooltip instructs us that we need to first select the object to 
						dilate, then the center of dilation (what point we are dilating towards), and
						then finally we will need to enter a dilation factor. Select C as the object to dilate,
						and then select B as the center of dilation. A dialog box will pop up. The ratio
						we want to use is the one we created above. This is the Number shown as 'a'
							in this example. Type 'a' in the dialog box and click 'Okay.' 
						</p>

					<div class = "tutorial-row">
						<div class="tutorial-left">
						<p> 
						A new point B' will be created with the desired dilation factor towards B. 
						Create segment A'B' and then dilate B' towards A' with the same ratio as we did
						above. This will create point ct.

					</div>
					<div class = "tutorial-row">
						<div class="tutorial-left">
						<p> <span id = "trace" class = "tutorial-p-head">Tracing a Point</span><br>
						We now will create a trace of point ct. 
						To do this right-click on ct (for Mac OS: Ctrl-click, for mobile devices long-tap).
							Then, choose  'Trace Point.'  As we move point A', all of the dilated points
							will move in kind, and point ct will leave a 'trace' of where it is moved to.
