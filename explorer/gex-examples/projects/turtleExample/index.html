<h3>
Turtles and the Geometry of Plants</h3></center>
<i>In this project we will investigate a way of modeling the geometry of
plants using L-systems. The goal of this project is for students to see
how the geometry of nature can be modeled using a very clever idea of re-writing
grammatical sentences.</i>
<p><b>Introduction</b>: What makes many plants hard to represent with simple
geometric figures like circles and lines is their branching structure.&nbsp;
A branch of a tree often looks much like the tree itself, and a branch's
sub-branches look like the branch itself, etc.&nbsp; To model branching,
we need a way to represent the branching structure itself as a blueprint,
much like the DNA molecule is a blueprint for human growth.&nbsp; We will
use the turtle geometry capability of Geometry Explorer to carry out blueprint
instructions.
<p>1. Start up Geometry Explorer.&nbsp; To create a turtle first we need
to create a turning angle and a heading vector for the turtle. These will
control how the turtle turns and moves forward.&nbsp; To create the turning
angle and heading vector create an angle ABC and a segment DE as shown
below.

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; To define the turn angle for the turtle select points
A, B, and C (in that order) and then choose "Turtle Turn Angle" under the
"Turtle" menu.&nbsp; To define the heading vector select D and E and choose
"Turtle Heading Vector" under the "Turtle" menu.&nbsp; Now, we can create
a turtle.&nbsp; The turtle needs to know where it is starting from, so
create a point (F in the figure below) and then select this point and choose
"Create Turtle at Point" under the "Turtle" menu. A nice green little turtle
will popup at F.&nbsp; It will be pointing in the direction of the heading
vector.&nbsp; A "Turtle Controller" dialog box will also popup.&nbsp; This
is the main controlling mechanism for our turtle.&nbsp; try hitting the
buttons in the "Turtle Control" group (e.g Back, Pop, etc) to see how we
can make the turtle travel around.&nbsp; Then, undo your actions until
the turtle is back at F.

<p>3.&nbsp; To create a branching structure blueprint, we will use symbols
to represent turtle actions.&nbsp; "F"&nbsp;will represent draw forward,
"+" and "-" will represent turning left and right and "[" and "]" will
represent the push and pop action.&nbsp; When we do a "push" we store the
turtle's location. When we do a "pop" the turtle immediately returns to
that location.&nbsp; We will also use a symbol "X" to denote a virtual
node of the plant that we are trying to create.&nbsp; Think of this as
being the potential growth of the plant at a branching node. Thus, initially
the plant as a seed can be represented by "X" itself as there are no branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the first period of growth suppose that the plant produces branches
as listed below.

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we represent this using our symbolic language?&nbsp;
Well, it is clear that the plant grew in such a way that three new branch
nodes were created from the original potential node at F.&nbsp; Thus, if
we started with "X" by itself, we must have replaced X with three new X's.&nbsp;
Also, these branches were created at an angle to the main branch, so there
needs to be some turning by the turtle.&nbsp; Finally, each new branch
has length of 2, if we consider one move forward to be a unit length for
the turtle.&nbsp; What kind of a "sentence" will represent this plant?&nbsp;
Consider the following:
<center>X = F[+X]F[-X]+X
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; F = FF</center>
What the first equation represents is that we will replace the X node by
the sentence
<br>F[+X]F[-X]+X.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the replacement will have a stalk of
length 1 ("F") a new branch node turned to the left and independent of
the previous F ("[+X]"), a second length of main stalk ("F"), a second
branch node coming off the stalk at an angle to the right ("[-X]"), and
finally a third branch coming off the top at an angle to the left.
<p>The second equation just says that a length of stalk will grow twice
as long in the next generation.
<br>Putting this all together, we have in these two equations a blueprint
for the growth of the plant. Let's see how this works.
<p>5.&nbsp; In the "Turtle Controller" window click on the "Grammar Turtle"
tab to get the grammar controller for the turtle.&nbsp; Type in "X" for
the axiom, and the two equations above in the "Productions" window, and
1 in the "Rewrite" box, and hit re-write.&nbsp; The axiom "X" will get
replaced according to the rules in the Production area.&nbsp; Now, hit
the "Turtle Interpret"&nbsp; button and watch the turtle interpret these
commands.

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not get the branches yet, as the three new X's
are <i>potential</i> branches.&nbsp; Undo the turtle back to F again.&nbsp;
Then, in the grammar window type in "2" for the rewrite level and hit rewrite.&nbsp;
Look at the new sentence and convince yourself that the level 1 sentence
was replaced correctly. Then, hit "Turtle Interpret" again to see the plant
starting to take shape.

<p>7.&nbsp; Undo the turtle back to F one last time. Then, use a rewrite
level of 3 and have the turtle interpret this.&nbsp; To get a nicer picture
let's hide all of the points. Choose "Hide All -> Points" under the "View"
menu. We can clearly see the outline of a plant structure here, without
the leaves.

<p>8. Try out your own version of an axiom and rewrite rules to see what
kinds of plants you can model. This method of using grammatical sentences
and re-writing to model plants was originally discovered by a fellow named
Lindenmayer, and thus this system of modeling plants has come to be known
as the "L-System".
