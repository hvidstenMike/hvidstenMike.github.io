<h3>
Euclidean Eggs: Over Easy</h3></center>
<i>In this project we will investigate the construction of ovals. The goal
of this project is for students to gain an understanding of how circle
arcs can be joined together smoothly.</i>
<br><i></i>&nbsp;<i></i>
<p><font color="#000000">1. An oval can be constructed by joining together
several circular arcs of varying radii. The join point must look "smooth",
that is there must be no bend or noticeable kink in the joined curve at
the join point. In his book <u>Mathographics</u></font>(Dover Publications,
1987) <font color="#000000">Robert Dixon describes a technique for joining
circular arcs that was known to the 15th century artist Albrecht Durer.
Durer used this technique to design an alphabet suitable for the printing
press.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The main idea used in Durer's technique
of joining arcs of different radii is that the join will be smooth (i.e.
the tangent lines will line up) if a straight line drawn through the centers
of the two arcs passes through the point where they join. For example,
in the figure below we have placed two points (Join and C1) on the segment
AB and then constructed two circles: one with center A and radius point
Join and the other with center C1 and radius point Join. Now, we attach
two points (P1, P2) to the first circle and two points (Q1, Q2) to the
second and construct the arcs on these sets of points. (The arcs are in
black) If we move P1 and Q1 to the join point we will have connected two
arcs of different radii, but the joined curve will be smooth at the intersection
point.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">2. How can we use this to make an oval, or more
precisely an egg shape? What we will do is join together 4 arcs to make
the egg.&nbsp; First, construct segment AB, the midpoint of AB, a perpendicular
to AB at the midpoint, circle c1 with center the midpoint of AB and radius
point B, circle c2 with center B and radius A, and circle c3 with center
A and radius B. Note that the bottom half of circle c1 will join smoothly
to arcs on c2 and c3 originating from B or A.</font>

<p><img SRC="oval2.gif" BORDER=1 height=289 width=416></center>

<p><font color="#000000">3. Next we will construct a small circle near
the top of the construction with center at the intersection of the perpendicular
and c1. Find this intersection point I1 and then construct two rays from
B through I1 and from A through I1. Find the intersections of these rays
with circles c2 and c3. Finally, construct a circle with center I1 and
radius point an intersection point of a ray with c2 or c3. In the figure
below you should be able to identify the shape of an egg by four circular
arcs.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">4. Next, find the intersection point I2 of the
top circle with center I1 and the perpendicular to AB. Then, construct
two rays: one through A and the bottom intersection of the top circle and
the perpendicular to AB, and the other though B and this bottom intersection
point. Then, find the intersections of these rays with c2 and c3. The points
in red, plus A and B, will define four arcs which will make up our egg.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">5. To finish off the construction, hide all objects
except A, B, and the points in red. Then, construct and arc on points A3,
I2, and B2. Finally, construct the arcs in blue and green to finish off
the construction of an "egg."</font>
