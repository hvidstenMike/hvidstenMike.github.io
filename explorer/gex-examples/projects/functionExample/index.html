<h3>
New Functions From Old</h3></center>
<i>In this project we will look at how we construct complex functions from
simple functions. The goal of this project is for students to develop a
concrete sense of how simple changes in the independent variable affect
a function.</i>
<p>1 Start up Geometry Explorer and choose "Show Axes" under the "Graph"
menu.&nbsp; We will be graphing various functions in this coordinate system.&nbsp;
Notice the points labeled "#origin" and "#unit".&nbsp; The origin point
can be moved to move the entire coordinate system.&nbsp; By moving the
unit point one can alter the apparent scale of the coordinate system.

<p>2. Now, choose "Add Function to Graph..." under the "Graph" menu.&nbsp;
A dialog box will pop up which will allow us to define a function f(x)=x^2.&nbsp;
To do this we type the name of the function and the value in the two text
fields as shown:
<center><img SRC="funcDef.jpeg" height=278 width=406></center>

<p>Once we hit the "Okay" button our function will show up in&nbsp; the
main program window.
<center><img SRC="func1.jpeg" BORDER=1 height=287 width=288></center>

<p>3.&nbsp; Now, we will create a new function g(x) = x-2.&nbsp; Go back
to the "Graph" menu and select "Add Function to Graph..."&nbsp; and type
in the definition of g.&nbsp; Instead of hitting the "Okay" button, just
hit the return key and the new function will appear in the program window.&nbsp;
Now type in a new function h(x) = f(g(x)), (i.e. the composition of f and
g).&nbsp; Before you hit the return key, think about what h(x) should look
like compared to the original function f.&nbsp; What should be the main
difference in the two graphs?

<p><img SRC="func2.jpeg" BORDER=1 height=275 width=655></center>

<p>4.&nbsp; Now, type in the definition for&nbsp; i(x) = g(f(x)), (the
composition the other way).&nbsp; Should this graph be the same as the
graph of h(x) = f(g(x))?&nbsp; Why or why not?
<p>5.&nbsp; We are now going to use the "dynamic" capability of the Geometry
Explorer software to look at this question of new functions from old.&nbsp;
Close the function dialog and click on the segment tool in the main window.
(The fourth button in the first row in the "Create" panel of buttons)&nbsp;
Then, click somewhere in the white drawing window and drag to create a
segment like AB below.&nbsp; After releasing the mouse, go to the "Measure"
menu and click on "Length", which should be highlighted.&nbsp; A measurement
of the length of segment AB will pop up in the window.

<p>6. Now, go to the "View" menu and click on "Calculator..." to bring
up a calculator as shown.&nbsp; You will see lots of buttons and a list
of Measures on the right.&nbsp; We will be able to use the Length measure
that we just defined as a parameter in the definition of a function.&nbsp;
Click the "x" button then "-" , then double-click on the Length measure
to define a function.&nbsp; Then, hit the "Evaluate" button to store this
definition. Finally, hit the "Add to Canvas" button.&nbsp; Another dialog
box will pop up asking for the name of this new function.&nbsp; Below we
have called it "shift". Hit "Okay" and then close the Calculator window.
<center><img SRC="calc.jpeg" height=395 width=434></center>

<p>7.&nbsp; A new function representing x-length(AB) will appear in the
main window. This is the line in red below.&nbsp; Now, choose "Add to Function
Graph..." again in the "Graph" menu and create a new function new(x) =
f(shift(x)).&nbsp; This is also shown below in red.
<center><img SRC="func4.jpeg" BORDER=1 height=432 width=423></center>

<p>8. Experiment with dragging point B back and forth to see what happens
to the two red functions as the length of AB changes.&nbsp; (Be patient,
the motion may be a bit jerky).&nbsp; When the length of AB is 2.0 what
happens?&nbsp; Given the results of this experiment, what will generally
happen if we are given a function f(x) and we alter x by replacing it with
x-c where c is some number?&nbsp; That is, what will happen to the graph
of f(x), where will it move to?&nbsp; What if we replace x by x+2, what
will happen then?&nbsp; Is the composite function g(f(x)) a simple motion
of f(x) as well? If so, how does this motion differ from the motion of
f under replacing x by x-c?
