<p><b><font size=+3>Why Use Software "Micro-Worlds" ?</font></b>
<p><i><font size=+2>Concrete actions and physical experimentation provide
fertile soil for the laying of more formal foundations of mathematics.</font></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>"My conjecture is that the computer can concretize and
personalize the formal.&nbsp; Seen in this light, it is not just another
powerful educational tool...&nbsp; Knowledge that was accessible only via
formal processes can now be approached concretely."&nbsp; Seymour Papert,
<u>Mind Storms</u></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>"Generally speaking, it is therefore impossible to maintain
that the concepts of intelligent thought are simply derived from the perceptions
through abstraction and generalization....&nbsp; Logico-mathematical concepts
presuppose a set of operations that are abstracted not from the objects
perceived but from the actions performed on these objects. " Jean Piaget
and Barbel Inhelder, The Psychology of the Child</font>
