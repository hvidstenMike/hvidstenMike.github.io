<h3>
Hyperbolic Geometry: Introduction</h3></center>
<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to
working in the geometry of the hyperbolic plane.
<p><b>0</b>) Start up Geometry Explorer. Once the main Geometry Explorer
window is open, go to the File menu and click on New. A dialog box will
pop up asking you to specify which type of geometry environment you wish
to work in. Choose "Hyperbolic" and hit okay.&nbsp; A new window will pop
up with a Poincare disk in the Canvas.&nbsp; Note that the window looks
almost identical to the Euclidean main window. Working in Hyperbolic geometry
with Geometry Explorer is essentially no different than working in Euclidean
geometry. Almost all of the tools work in both environments with a few
exceptions that depend on the Euclidean parallel postulate.
<p>We will be working in Hyperbolic geometry for some time, so it would
be nice to have the program start up in hyperbolic mode. Go to the Edit
menu and click on Preferences.&nbsp; A dialog box will pop up with program
preferences. One of these is "Geometry Type". Click on "Hyperbolic" and
then on the "Apply" button. A preferences file (called "geometryExplorer-Preferences")
will be written to your user home directory.&nbsp; The next time the program
starts up it will read this file and act accordingly.
<p><b>1</b>) In the first exercise of this lab we will look at triangles
in the hyperbolic plane.&nbsp; Using the segment tool in the Create Panel,
create a triangle ABC in the Poincare disk and measure its interior angles.&nbsp;
(Remember to be careful as to angle orientation). Then, use the Calculator
to find the sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC.

Note that the sum of the angles is not 180 degrees, as in Euclidean Geometry.
In fact, the angle sum is less than 180 degrees. In the first part of this
lab I want you to speculate on the behavior of triangles in hyperbolic
space. Without doing anything on the computer think about and then write
down what you think will happen in the following situations:
<ul>1) The three vertices of the triangle approach the boundary circle.
<br>2) The three vertices of the triangle shrink down to almost a single
point.</ul>
Now, carry out some experiments on the computer and record the results.
Are your conjectures verified?&nbsp; Hyperbolic geometry is often called
"locally" Euclidean. What do you think this means in terms of the experiments
above?
<p><b>2</b>) In the second part of the lab we will consider parallels.&nbsp;
Clear the Canvas and draw a single line DE. Create a point P somewhere
off of line DE.&nbsp; Then, select line DE and point P (in that order)
and click on the parallel button to construct two special parallels to
line DE through P. These are called <i>asymptotic or limiting</i> <i>parallels</i>.&nbsp;
An asymptotic parallel to DE is by definition a <b>boundary </b>line between
the set of lines that intersect DE with the lines that do not intersect
DE. Using the point tool, place a point on each of these two parallels,
call the two points R and S.&nbsp; Now, drop a perpendicular from point
P to line DE and construct the intersection point Q. (Remember to use the
intersection tool in the Construct Panel to find the true intersection
point)&nbsp; Finally measure angles RPQ and QPS.
<center><img SRC="hyperTri2.gif" height=422 width=420></center>
Note that these angles are equal. Move point P around and also line DE.
Does this angle relationship always hold?&nbsp; Your first proof for this
lab is to show that these two angles are always equal. [Hint: try an indirect
proof.&nbsp; Suppose WLOG that angle RPQ > angle QPS.
<br>&nbsp;Then, in the interior of angle RPQ we can find an angle (say
VPQ) that is congruent to angle QPS.&nbsp; Then line VP must intersect
DE (Why?) Use this intersection point to construct two congruent triangles
with common side of PQ and&nbsp; then generate a contradiction.]
<p><b>3</b>) It appears that the angles are always acute. Your second assignment
is to prove this result. [Hint: From the class notes we know that this
angle is at most a right angle (why?).&nbsp; Show that the angle cannot
be a right angle. ]
<p><b>4</b>)&nbsp; Spend some time constructing figures in this Hyperbolic
model. Experiment with some of the constructions we have looked at so far
in class.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Summary</b>: As Janos Bolyai (one of the discoverers of non-euclidean
geometry) said "I have discovered such wonderful things that I was amazed
... out of nothing I have created a strange new universe."&nbsp; Hyperbolic
geometry is indeed a very weird place.&nbsp; However, it has proven to
be a very useful geometry for modern theories of the geometry of the universe.&nbsp;
We will be studying this amazing universe during the next few weeks.
