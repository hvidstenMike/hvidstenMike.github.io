<h3>
Hyperbolic Geometry: Omega Triangles and Quadrilaterals</h3></center>

<center><b>Due: Monday, November 2</b></center>
<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this lab is to investigate some of the "classical"
figures of study in hyperbolic geometry.
<p><b>0</b>) Start up Geometry Explorer (remember that you may have to
type "./explorer" and not just "explorer" to start up the program).&nbsp;
If the main Geometry Explorer window is not a Hyperbolic window, go to
the File menu and click on New and choose "Hyperbolic".
<p><b>1</b>) In the first exercise of this lab we will look at a figure
called an "Omega Triangle." Construct a line AB and a point C off of the
line. Then, construct the two ultraparallels to AB through C. (select AB
and then C and click on the parallel construction tool) The ultraparallels
do not intersect AB in the Poincare disk. However, they do intersect at
two points at infinity which we will call omega and omega'.
<p>Construct a line through C that intersects AB and find the intersection
point D (use the intersection tool).&nbsp; Then, points D and C, together
with omega, define what we will call an <b>omega </b>or <b>ideal </b>triangle.&nbsp;
An omega triangle is not an true triangle in hyperbolic geometry, but it
does share some of the properties of regular triangles.&nbsp; Recall that
in Euclidean neutral geometry that an exterior angle of a triangle is greater
than
<br>either opposite interior angle.&nbsp; (Euclid, Book I, Prop. 16)&nbsp;
Since this result is neutral it must hold for hyperbolic triangles. Does
it hold for omega triangles?
<p>Place a point E on line DC and a point F on the right ultraparallels
as shown. Then, measure exterior angle FCE and interior angle BDC.&nbsp;
It appears that the exterior angle is bigger in this case. (Note that there
really is only one angle to worry about here, as the other angle at omega
is not really an angle) Move point C around and see whether the exterior
angle remains larger.&nbsp; The first proof in this lab is to prove this
relationship always holds: that exterior angle FCE is always larger than
interior angle BDC. {Hint: Suppose not. Then, either FCE is less than BDC
or is equal to BDC. In the first case get a contradiction to the regular
triangle exterior angle theorem. In the second case get a contradiction
by dropping a perpendicular down from the midpoint of CD to AB and 
showing that the angle of parallelism is 90 degrees.]

<p><b>2</b>) In the second part of this lab we will look at a congruence
result for omega triangles.&nbsp; As shown below, construct a line AB and
a point C off of AB. Then, construct the ultraparallels to AB at C and
hide the left ultraparallel. Place a point D on the right ultraparallel.&nbsp;
Next, construct another line EF. We will now construct a point G such that
angle EFG is equal to angle BAC and length FG is equal to length AC. To
do this first select points B,A, and C (in that order) and then choose
"Angle" under the "Set As" menu in the Transform panel.&nbsp; Then, select
point F and choose "Center" under the "Set As" menu. We have now defined
a hyperbolic rotation with center of rotation F and angle of rotation BAC.
We rotate point E by selecting E and then hitting the rotate button in
the transform panel.&nbsp; Call the rotated point P. Note that this point
P is not necessarily the point G that is desired, although P lies in the
same direction as G.&nbsp; Construct ray FP. To find G, we construct a
circle at F of radius AC. (Select F and then segment CD and hit the circle
<b>construction
</b>tool) Then, find the intersection of this circle with ray FP. This
is the desired point G.
<p>To summarize we have two omega triangles AC(omega1) and FG(omega2) such
that a corresponding side and angle are congruent. Now measure the other
interior angles (ACD and FGH). Note that they are equal.&nbsp; Drag point
C around. Does the equality of angles persist?&nbsp; Prove this SA congruence
theorem for omega triangles.
<br>[Hint: Suppose angle FGH is greater than ACD. Find two congruent "regular"
triangles that lead to a contradiction.]

<p><b>3</b>) In the third part of the lab we will consider a special four-sided
figure called a Saccheri Quadrilateral. This quadrilateral has two right
angles on the base and two congruent sides from the base.&nbsp; To construct
a Saccheri Quadrilateral, we start by constructing a segment AB to serve
as the base. Then, construct two perpendiculars to AB at points A and B.
Next, attach a point C to the perpendicular on the right. Hide the perpendicular
on the right and construct segment BC.&nbsp; Next select point A and segment
BC and use the circle <b>constructor </b>tool to construct a circle at
A of radius equal to the length of segment BC.&nbsp; Find the intersection
of this circle with the left perpendicular. Hide the left perpendicular,
the lower intersection point, and the circle. Finally, construct the segment
AD at the left and the segment CD, finishing the Saccheri construction.&nbsp;
All of the construction lines and circles are shown in the figure below
on the right. At the left is the Saccheri quad with construction aids hidden.

<p>Next, find the midpoints E and F of sides AB and CD. Measure angles
FEA and DEF.&nbsp; Prove that these angles are always right angles.
<p><b>4</b>) Measure the summit angles ADF and FCB.&nbsp; Move point C
around and note that the summit angles are always congruent and acute.&nbsp;
Prove that the summit angles are always congruent.
<p><b>5</b>) Prove that the summit angles are always acute. Here is a start
at the proof: (Fill in the <i>Show </i>parts)
<ul>At C find an ultraparallel (call it l) to AB on the right. Let the
ideal point be omega.&nbsp; The ultraparallel to AB through D (call it
m) will also be ultraparallel to l (using the transitivity result from
class)
<br>Now, DC must be an parallel (non-intersecting line) to AB. (<i>Show</i>)
Thus, the right ultraparallels through D and C must lie within the angles
ADC and BCE, where E is a point on DC to the right of C.&nbsp; Next, angles
AD(omega) and BC(omega) are equal. (<i>Show</i>) Furthermore, since l and
m are ultraparallel then in omega triangle CD(omega) exterior angle EC(omega)
must be greater than interior angle CD(omega). Finally, this proves that
angles ADC and BCD are less than 90 (<i>Show</i>).

</ul>

<p><br><b>6</b>) Define a Lambert quadrilateral to be a quadrilateral having
three right angles.&nbsp; Prove that the fourth angle must be acute.
<p><b>Summary</b>: Lambert and Saccheri tried to prove Euclid's fifth axiom
by using their quadrilaterals to prove that the summit angles in the Saccheri
quad (or the fourth angle for Lambert) must be right angles. This would
then imply Euclid's fifth axiom.&nbsp; They both of course failed, but
they were not bold enough to accept the possibility that a new geometry
different than Euclidean geometry was possible.
<p>We have enough tools at our disposal now to prove a very interesting
result: that the sum of the angles in a right triangle is less than two
right angles.&nbsp; Think about how you might prove this. We will look
at the proof later in class.
