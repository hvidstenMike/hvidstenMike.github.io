<h3>
Hitting the Slopes</h3></center>
<i>In this project we will investigate the idea of the slope of the graph
of a function. The goal of this project is for students to gain an appreciation
of the notion of slope for a non-linear function and also insight into
the idea that the slope of a function is itself a function.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1. Start up Geometry Explorer.&nbsp; Choose "Show Axes" under the "Graph"
menu.&nbsp; We will be working with the function&nbsp; f(x) = x^2.&nbsp;
We will create the graph of f(x) by choosing "Add Function to Graph..."
under the "Graph" menu.&nbsp; A dialog box will pop up which will allow
us to define f(x) = x^2.&nbsp; Type in "f" and "x^2" in the two text fields
as shown:

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we hit the "Okay" button our function will show
up in the main window.

<p>3.&nbsp; Now we will "attach" a point to the graph of this parabola.&nbsp;
Click on the point tool (2nd button in first row of buttons labeled "Create")&nbsp;
and then click the mouse somewhere on top of the parabola.&nbsp; A point
will be created that will always be attached to the parabola, even as we
move it around. Next we will create the tangent line to the graph at A.&nbsp;
Select point A and then choose "Tangent to Arc/Circle/Function at Point"
under the "Misc" menu.

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we want to analyze the slope of the tangent line
to this function.&nbsp; Select the tangent line and then choose "Slope"
under the "Measure" menu.&nbsp; Also, select point A and choose "x-coordinate"
under the "Measure" menu.&nbsp; We can now consider graphing the pair of
values (x-coord(A), slope(tangent))&nbsp; on the graph as an x-y pair.&nbsp;
To do this, select the xCoord and slope measurements in the window (in
that order) and select "Add as (x,y) point from Measures" from the "Graph"
menu.&nbsp; A new point will be plotted in the coordinate system representing
this pair of measurements. This point is called "slope point" below.

<p>5.&nbsp; Drag point A back and forth and notice what happens to the
slope point.&nbsp; What type of curve does it seem to trace out?&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can actually create a trace for this point. Select the slope point and
then choose "Trace On" from the "Edit" menu.

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; It looks like the set of slopes for
the function f(x) = x^2 is actually on a line.&nbsp; In general the set
of slopes for a given function f(x) will itself be a new function which
we call the derivative of f(x).&nbsp; In this case the derivative appears
to be linear.
<p>7. Try out this same analysis with the function f(x) = sin(x).&nbsp;
What other trigonometric function appears to be the derivative of sin(x)?&nbsp;&nbsp;
