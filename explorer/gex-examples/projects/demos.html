<p><font size=+1>Golden Ratio:&nbsp; </font>Periodically in J-term I teach
a course called "Geometry and the Imagination" for general education credit.&nbsp;
One of the activities that I have students do is to discover the golden
ratio.&nbsp; We do this by first scanning in photos of each student.&nbsp;
Then, we create a "ruler" to measure ratios of the face. Since the eyes
are such a central component of the face, we compute the ratio of the distance
from the eyebrows to the bottom of the chin over the distance from the
top of the head to the eyebrows.&nbsp; We average these ratios over all
the students and find a number somewhere around 1.6.
<p>Then, we experiment with sub-dividing a segment and computing various
ratios of the sub-segments. One of these is the ratio of the entire segment
to a longer sub-segment and another is the ratio of the longer sub-segment
to the shorter.&nbsp; Students are then asked to find where these two ratios
match up. Surprisingly, at least to the students, they again come up with
the ratio of about 1.6.&nbsp; A homework assignment is to find as many
instances of this ratio as they can in nature, buildings, appliances, etc.
<p><font size=+1>Holonomy and Curved Space</font>: In the upper-level Geometry
course that I teach I have the students open up a Hyperbolic micro-world
in Geometry Explorer and then observe what happens to figures as they are
moved around in that world.&nbsp; First, I have them take a figure and
move it in a broad loop near the boundary of the Poincare disk.&nbsp; Then,
they are asked to move the figure in a very small loop.&nbsp; From this
experience, students gain a very intuitive idea of what it means for a
space to be "curved" and yet still "locally Euclidean".&nbsp; After doing
this lab we move on to mathematically define holonomy, parallel transport,
curvature and finally talk about the Gauss-Bonnet Formula. Students have
a much better appreciation for what these results mean after seeing the
"physical" manifestations of these in the hyperbolic micro-world.
<p><font size=+1>Turtle Geometry and L-Systems</font>:&nbsp; Geometry courses
are often somewhat "sterile" in that there is not much discussion of the
geometry of the natural world.&nbsp; As Benoit Mandelbrot was fond of saying
"Montains are not cones, clouds are not spheres, trees are not cylinders".&nbsp;
I end the upper-level Geometry course with a unit on fractals and in particular
on Lindenmayer Systems (or L-Systems).&nbsp; These are grammar re-writing
systems that can be used to model the branching and growth parameters of
plants. In a lab on L-systems students learn about turtle geometry and
then about how grammars can be used to encapsulate the "blueprints" of
plants.
