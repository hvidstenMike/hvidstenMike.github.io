<h3>
Fun With Triangles</h3></center>
<i>In this project we will investigate some interesting properties of triangles.&nbsp;
In particular we will see how to construct three special points associated
to a triangle: the <a href="#circumcenter">circumcenter</a>, <a href="#orthocenter">orthocenter</a>,
and <a href="#incenter">incenter</a>.</i>
<p><a NAME="circumcenter"></a>Part I: The <b>Circumcenter</b> of a triangle
<blockquote>1. Start up Geometry Explorer.&nbsp; Using the segment tool
construct a triangle ABC in the Canvas. Then, select all three sides and
click on the midpoint tool to construct the midpoints to each of the sides.</blockquote>

<p>2.&nbsp; Next, select, in turn, each side and its midpoint and click
on the perpendicular tool to construct the three perpendicular bisectors
of each side.

4. Note that it appears that the three perpendicular bisectors intersect
at a common point.&nbsp; Drag vertices A, B, and C around.&nbsp; Does this
common intersection property persist?&nbsp; This common point is called
the <b>circumcenter
</b>of the triangle.&nbsp; Select two of the perpendicular
bisectors and click on the intersection tool to find the circumcenter G.&nbsp;
Then, construct a circle with center at the circumcenter and radius out
to to one of the vertices of the triangle. What do you notice about the
circle in relation to the vertices of the triangle. This circle is called
the <b>circumscribed circle </b>about the triangle.

</blockquote>
<a NAME="orthocenter"></a>Part II:&nbsp; The <b>Orthocenter</b> of a triangle.
<blockquote>1. Construct a new triangle ABC in the Canvas. Then, construct
the perpendiculars from each side to the opposite vertex.&nbsp; It appears
that the three perpendiculars intersect at a common point, point O in the
figure. This point is called the <b>orthocenter</b> of the triangle.&nbsp;
Construct a circle at the intersection point with radius out to one of
the vertices.&nbsp; What do you notice different about this situation in
comparison to the example above?

<p><br><a NAME="incenter"></a>Part III: The <b>Incenter</b> of a triangle.
<blockquote>1. Construct a new triangle ABC in the Canvas. Then, construct
the angle bisectors of each angle of the triangle.&nbsp; For example, to
construct the bisector on angle CAB we would select (in order) points C,
A, and B and click on the bisector tool.&nbsp; Note that angles are oriented
in Geometry Explorer and you must select the vertices of an angle in the
proper order.&nbsp; It appears that yet again the three bisectors intersect
at a common point called the <b>incenter</b> of the triangle.

<p>2. There is a special circle associated to the incenter.&nbsp; To construct
this circle, drop a perpendicular line from the incenter to one of the
sides of the triangle, and find the intersection of this perpendicular
with the side.&nbsp; Call this point J. Construct a circle with center
at the incenter and radius at J.&nbsp; This circle is the <b>inscribed
circle</b> to the triangle.
<br>Drag points A, B, and C around. What special properties does the incenter
have?
