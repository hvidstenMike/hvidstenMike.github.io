However, on paper such      constructions      are static -- points placed on the paper can never be moved      again.&nbsp;      In Geometry Explorer, all constructions are dynamic. One can draw a      segment      and then grab one of the endpoints and move it around the canvas, with      the segment moving accordingly.&nbsp; Thus, one can create a      construction      and test out hypotheses about the construction with an infinite number      of possible variations of the original construction. Geometry Explorer      is just what the name implies -- an environment to explore geometry.      <p>Geometry Explorer can easily be used to access <b>Web-based</b>        information.        There is an Internet browser built in to the program that allows        hyperlinks        to Web pages to be inserted directly into a geometry construction. The        Help system consists of a series of inter-linked Web pages that are        accessed        via the built-in browser.&nbsp; (You do <i>not </i>need to be        connected        to the Internet to use the Help system.)&nbsp;<br>      </p>      <p><b>Non-Euclidean geometry</b> can easily be explored using        Geometry        Explorer. Constructions can be carried out in a Euclidean or non-Euclidean
(Hyperbolic,        Elliptic, or Spherical Geometry) environment using the same user        interface. Almost all        actions that apply in the Euclidean environment can be carried out in        the        non-Euclidean environment (with a few important exceptions that depend        on the parallel postulate). </p>      <p><b>Fractal geometry</b> can be explored using turtle graphics and        grammatical        descriptions of fractals. In turtle graphics, one controls a "turtle"        on        the screen by telling it to move, draw, rotate, change color, etc.        Grammar-based        descriptions of fractals encapsulate a fractal's structure by sentences        of symbols. These sentences can then be interpreted as a series of        turtle        actions. </p>      <p><b>Analytic Geometry</b> can be explored in a dynamic        fashion.&nbsp;        Graphs of functions can be constructed and then changed dynamically        based        on parameters. Points can be attached to graphs allowing for the study        of tangents and reflection properties. "Cobweb" diagrams for iterated        functions        can be easily created and updated dynamically. </p>      <p>Geometry Explorer is designed to <b>assist the classroom</b>        teacher.        Text areas can be created on the screen so that additional information        can be included with a construction.&nbsp; If a large amount of textual        information must accompany a construction, this can be included in a        separate        Notebook with the construction.&nbsp; Web pages can be referenced        directly        from the Geometry Explorer window. A fully functional calculator        is included for carrying out detailed calculations with measurements        and        other numerical values. Images in a wide variety of formats can be        imported        and exported from the program.&nbsp; Finally, there is the ability to        make        ``recordings'' of sequences of steps (macros) that can then be used in        other constructions.</p>    </ul>  </body></html>
